# Weather-Forecast

## Description
Weather Forecast uses a server-side API called 'OpenWeather One Call API' to allow users to search the weather in different cities by presenting the conditions for that day, as well as a five-day forecast.

Here is a link to the deployed application: https://acho93.github.io/Weather-Forecast/
